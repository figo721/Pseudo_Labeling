# Pseudo_Labeling

This is a personal project for the master's in Bioinformatics (AI in LIFE SCIENCE) at the Institute of Machine Learning, JKU. The idea of Pseudo-Labeling is introduced by Dong-Hyun LEE (The Simple and Efficient Semi-Supervised Learning Method for Deep Neural Networks). 
This project's main task is to use the semi-supervised learning model to train both labeled and unlabeled training datasets and then analyze the results.

The paper of this project is working on!!
